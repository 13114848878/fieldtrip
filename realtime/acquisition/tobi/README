# Overview
The TOBI project defines a standardized interface called TiA (TOBI interface A)
to transmit raw biosignals, supporting multirate and block-oriented
transmission of different kinds of signals from various acquisition devices
(e.g., EEG, electrooculogram, near-infrared spectroscopy signals, etc.) at the
same time [1].

Interoperability between on streams provided with the TiA and the FieldTrip
buffer is provided with tia2ft. Tia2ft can connect to a TiA server, and serve
the incoming data trough a FieldTrip buffer, or optionally, push it to an
external FieldTrip buffer (potentially run on a different device).

Currently, only homogenous signal streams (i.e. with a single sampling rate)
are supported.

# Usage


# Compiling
For compiling tia2ft, you can do the following:

1. build libbuffer.a in /realtime/buffer/src by issuing "make",
2. build tia2ft by issuing "make" in /realtime/acquisition/tobi/.


Then, it can simply be run with:
  $ ./tia2ft.sh --serve-ft-buffer


# Testing tia2ft
To test tia2ft, we can use the TOBI signal server to generate artificial
signals. With the TOBI signal servers version 8ea1376, a TiA serving sine-waves can be started as follows:

  $ ./server.sh bin/server_config.xml

When this sever is running, tia2ft can connect to this server.
